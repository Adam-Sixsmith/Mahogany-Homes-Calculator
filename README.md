A small calculator I made while trying to achieve 99 Contruction in OSRS.

I made this calculator for fun to see how many contracts I had left to do until a given level, I've not yet reached the experience to be able to input a desired level and have the calculator know the total experience you would need to have, so this calculator expects the total experience number you need to achieve, for example if you're looking to get 99 construction you would need to put in 13,034,431 (Without the commas) 

This calculator has been built with the assumption you're using Mahogany planks with the full Carpenters outfit as this was based on my own account. As mentioned in the comments of the code, I worked out on average the total xp for a contract was ~4,445xp per contract which worked out to be about right once I achieved 99 Construction.
